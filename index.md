# 🧠 Evolutionary Computation and Large Language Models

Welcome to the companion site for the survey:

**[Evolutionary Computation and Large Language Models: A Survey of Methods, Synergies, and Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15741)**  
*Authors: Dikshit Chauhan, Bapi Dutta, Indu Bala, Niki van Stein, Thomas Bäck, Anupam Yadav*  

## 📘 Abstract

We present a systematic survey of how **LLMs** and **Evolutionary Computation (EC)** can mutually benefit from each other through synergy. The paper covers prompt engineering, architecture search, hyperparameter tuning, and automated metaheuristic generation.
